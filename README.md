Research Question:

Can we calculate total hours worked from CityTime for employees at the Department of Buildings, taking into consideration leave and overtime?

A major technical issue related to CityTime data is that when leave occurs accross two months, the total leave is dumped into one month. 

Another technical challenge is to calculate leave using working days, and not including holidays and weekends.

This python program corrects the leave technical issues and calculates correct leave, overtime and total hours worked for all employees for one year of historical data.
